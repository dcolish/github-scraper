Github-Scraper
==============

I couldn't think of a clever name for this project so it is what it is. It'll
pull your data into a couchdb instance and then use that instance to generate
the graphs. 

Yeah, I know there's no setup.py yet, instead pip install the following:

- networkx
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pygraphviz
- couchdb

Then relax and let the crawling begin!!
